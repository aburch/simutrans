/*
 * This file is designed to contain the unit conversion routines
 * which were previously scattered all over the Simutrans code.
 *
 * Some are still scattered all over the code.  So this file also documents
 * where the other conversion routines are.
 *
 * I have tried to leave out stuff which should be internal to the display
 * and have no gameplay consequences.
 *
 * DISTANCE units:
 * 1 -- tiles
 * 2 -- "internal pixels" -- 16 per tile.  Old steps per tile.
		-- OBJECT_OFFSET_STEPS, located in simconst.h
		-- important to the internal rendering engine
		-- used for locating images such as trees within a tile
		-- same value as carunits, but conceptually different....
 * 3 -- "carunits" or vehicle length units -- same as old steps per tile
        -- Length of trains & other vehicles (as specified in paks)
        -- is measured in this unit.  Currently this is very hard to alter.
 * 4 -- vehicle steps
        -- trains can be on one of 2^8 = 256 locations along a tile horizontally (not
           diagonally).
 * 5 -- "yards" -- tiny distance units used internally
        -- 2^12 per vehicle steps, by definition
		-- 2^16 per vehicle steps in older code
		-- chosen to maximize precision of certain interfaces
 * 6 -- km -- 1/tile in standard
 *
 * TIME units:
 * 1 -- ticks -- referred to as ms or milliseconds in old code
 * 2 -- months -- determined by world_t::ticks_per_world_month
 *      -- you may also use world_t::ticks_per_world_month_shift
 * 3 -- days -- derived from months
 * 4 -- years -- derived from months
 * 5 -- hours & minutes -- NOT derived from months, implied by vehicle speed
 * 6 -- actual real-time milliseconds -- only for game speed setting
 *      -- no meaning in-game
 *
 * SPEED units:
 * 1 -- "internal" speed -- yards per tick.
 *      -- this is multiplied by delta_t, which is in ticks (in convoi_t::sync_step)
 *      -- to get distance travelled in yards (passed to vehikel_t:fahre_basis)
 * 2 -- km/h -- core setting here is VEHICLE_SPEED_FACTOR
 * 3 -- tiles per tick
 * 4 -- steps per tick
 *
 * ELECTRICITY units:
 * 1 -- "internal" units
 * 2 -- megawatts
 * This conversion still lives in dings/leitung2.h, not here
