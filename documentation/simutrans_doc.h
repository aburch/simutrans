 * @section s_squirrel squirrel Scripting language
 * ------------------
 *
 * The scripts have to be written in squirrel. The manual can be found at <a href="http://squirrel-lang.org/">Squirrel main page</a>.
 * As squirrels like to crack nuts, understandably the script files get the extension '.nut'.
