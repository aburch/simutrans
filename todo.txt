To be done:
- weight limit on ways by axle_load entry in vehicles (to avoid problem when going back and forth with diff. load)
- busy platform images
- city wayobj instead just sidewalks
- building/tree heights in dats
- fog view to the top?
- instant text updates
- bahnhofsdetaildialog (more text on the station buildings)

partially done:
- connection weighted by their intermediate stops => A* for goods routing [A* did not worked out, but intermediate stops may be considered]

reconsider:
- leave stop if other convoi has arrived there patch
- viewports (even if they are perfomance killers ... )
- routing penalty sign (but a proper one)
