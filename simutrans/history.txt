           CHANGE: finance window now remembers size and settings if

                box in the vehicles schedule window no longer causes
                a crash.
           FIX: fixed a crash if a way without an owner was built (this
                problem was introduced by the fix for correct maintenance
                cost after replacing a way with another type of way

           CHANGE: if a passenger destination is a water square, the

                   destinations entirely but reduces them a lot.
           CHANGE: factories now produce passengers (commuting workers)
                   and mail properly
           CHANGE: theatre now has "Leuchtreklame" and lit windows

22-Aug-04: CHANGE: line management window now remembers size and settings

                   -> fills empty middle of 3x3 block of houses

                      regardless of station size

01-Aug-04: FIX: limited max distance for pathfinder to 480 steps. This
                fixes a crash of a route with almost 512 step was found
                and a train wants to add additional steps. The chosen
                parameters are safe for trains up to 31 carriages. This
                should be ok, since the player can't set up trains longer
                than 16 carriages.

                creation of mail and passengers
           FIX: one more bugfix to make Simutrans run past year 2612
           CHANGE: I've tried a kind of 'optimization'. koord3d objects
                   formerly had a size of 6 bytes, which is bad for both
                   32 bit and 64 bit systems. I've now squeezed them in
                   4 bytes -> this means they require less memory and are
                   better aligned in memory, but the components now are
                   11 and 10 bits in size which adds some overhead to
                   component accesses. Right now, I don't know if the
                   tradeoff will be a win or a loss ... please let me
                   know about your experiences.
           CHANGE: (DarioK)
                   Passengers now check for destination station before
                   doing pathfinding. This is slower for new games with
                   only few stations, but faster for big games with a
                   lot of interconnected stations
           FIX: (Hendrik)
                loading games with 0 factories works again

                   change should allow to play Simutrans games beyond

           Included Hendriks updates:

           rather than subtracting

           Change:
           added ev_key_mod to event struct (ev_key_mod holds key modifiers,
           such as SHIFT, ALT, STRG, etc); required for new features (see
           below)

           New:
           overview map enhancement (show connected industries; shows
           customers default, use SHIFT to show suppliers) map zooms in/out
           respecting SHIFT key

           Change:
           savegame version now 84007 (was required for new curve in finance
           window)
           if user clicks into the scrollbar, top-left or bottom-right the

           created if required, only);

           Change:
           savegame version now 84007 (was required for new curve in
           finance window)

Released Simutrans 0.84.8.6

31-May-04 CHANGE/FIX: station<->factory link is now bidirectional, this
                      means, situations in which a station was linked
                      to a factory but the factory not linked to the
                      station cannot occur anymore. In games with many
                      stations and factories, this change should also
                      save a little bit of CPU time for other tasks.
                      Attention: the link has a length of 4 squares,
                                 this means, there can be at most 2
                                 squares between the station and the
                                 factory (unless the station has an
                                 irregular shape, e.g. T-shaped).
          FIX: building powerlines no longer crashes the game
          FIX: new cities can only be built on empty, flat squares
          FIX: new cities no longer can be built on water
          FIX: added a missing space to station detail info
               string (indention of "goods needed by factories" list)
          CHANGE: splash screen now uses proportional font

Released Simutrans 0.84.8.5

19-May-04 CHANGE: if user has not selected a language yet, Simutrans

                  use in scenarios
          CHANGE: mouse pointer is now shown on splash screen

               engine type "steam"
          FIX: horses got engine type "bio"
          CHANGE: depot frame now deduces engine type from vehicle
                  data instead from vehicle name (this means that
                  in old translations, the type will be listed twice!)
          CHANGE: news ticker discards newly incoming messages that have
                  the same text as the last shown message

15-Apr-04 CHANGE: moved scenario specific texts into scenario
                  directory, and adapted translator to read them

               depots again after opening their info window

10-Apr-04 CHANGE: saved games of versions < 84006 became incompatible due
                  to an accident. I can't revert this accident, so the
                  game now treats such saved games as incompatible and
                  gives an appropriate message instead of crashing

Simutrans 0.84.8.1 for developers only

09-Apr-04 FIX: added a safety check to vehicle list, to avoid a crash
               if the entry of a just deleted vehicle is clicked

                  character buffer objects instead of plain character

                  memory (i.e. buffer overrun) problems

               to simuconf.tab

          CHANGE: included updated danish translation from

          NEW: included new, downscaled, oil rig from 128x128 pixel
               tileset made by James Starr
               WARNING: this one is 3x3 squares - the old one was 2x2
                        if you load old games, that have things near
                        oil rigs, there might be bad effects if the
                        new oil rigs overlap the existing things!
               WORKAROUND: get the old factory.Oelbohrinsel.pak from
                        the 0.84.0.1 base package and use it instead
                        of the new one.

          NEW: added "topspeed" parameter to bridge dat files
          CHANGE: removed bridgepos parameter from bridge dat files
          NEW: speed limit for bridges (not really sure if that works
               for sure it won't affect existing bridges in old games,
               only newly built bridges)
          NEW: bridge tool tooltips now list additional information
               (price, speed limit)
          WARNING: the changes to the bridge DAT/PAK files introduced
                   a slight incompatibility with former bridge PAK files:
                   the old files do not store icon information for the
                   menu. Thus if you use old PAK files with this
                   version, the bridge tools menu will show empty icons.
                   The tooltips will help to identify the correct sort
                   of bridge.
                   -> ATM this only affects the 128x128 pixel tile set
                      and selfmade bridges. Both must be updated to
                      include icon information and recompiled with
                      MakeObj 0.1.6
                   -> See datfiles_15-Feb-04.zip for examples

11-Feb-04 NEW (by Hendrik): line selection in depot window now got
                            a drop-down list (click into the input
                            field to open)
          CHANGE (by Hendrik): vehicle info window now shows total
                            running cost
          NEW: a simple tree planting tool (hotkey /)

                   altered if you load a game that was created with
                   a different language setting)

               the roads (= time spent during map creation) can be
               configured with a simuconf.tab entry - if map creation
               is too slow now on your computer, edit simuconf.tab
               and lower the max road length.
          NEW: overhead wires now have a maintenance cost of
               2 CR/month (configurable via simuconf.tab)

10-Jan-04 NEW: back ported Gaz-4 goods truck from 128x128 set to 64x64

09-Jan-04 NEW: started to work on introduction dates for vehicles
               Currently they are just stored in the PAK files and
               displayed in the depot window - no effect on gameplay
               yet.

               MakeObj 0.1.5 support two new attributes for vehicles:

                 intro_year (int):  Year of introduction
                 intro_month (int): Month in year

                 gear (int): gear of engines - will work as power
                             multiplier.

               If you create PAK files, make sure to include them in
               your dat files!!!

               The gear value is an factor to distinguish freight
               train engines and passenger train engines - freight
               train engines use to have a larger gear value, this
               means they have less top speed but they can pull heavier
               trains. (Of course this is only an approximation to
               reality)

               I've assigned a few introduction dates and gear values
               to trucks, and some train engines, but I think I need
               help to assign proper values to all vehicles.

          CHANGE: risen max map size to 1024x1024

08-Jan-04 FIX: fixed a bug in rtrim() function that caused characters
               128-255 to be treated as whitespace (effect: city names
               ending in umlauts or accented characters got those
               characters removed)

                  related problems after loading a saved game
               -> This might also fix the trashed line names in

          CHANGE: resolutions of width 1400 and 1600 now try to open

released Simutrans 0.83.1.2

29-Dec-03 FIX: changed convoi waiting times from steps to real time
               -> with this fix, waiting times should consider the
                  time lapse factor
          FIX: fixed a crash if station-connections are being rebuild
               while there is a vehicle without a schedule
          FIX: made two more entries of the lines management window
               translatable.
          FIX: fixed a bug that could produce the same line id twice
               (two lines with same id severely screw up the line
               management, this was an important fix).
          CHANGE: included new fi.tab provided by Antti Louko
          CHANGE: included citylist_en_gb.txt from the feedback forum

released Simutrans 0.83.1.1

28-Dec-03 FIX: fixed this problem:
                1. buy 4 wagons (without an engine)
                2. add a waypoint to the schedule of the convoi
                3. try to start the convoi
                4. error message appears (convoi cannot drive,
                   because it has no engine)
                5. click on 'put in front' button
                6. buy an engine
                => crash
               This fix required a major rework of the schedule handling.
               I'm not sure how stable the new code is.
          FIX: removing signals from circle-shaped rail blocks did
               not work properly. This is fixed now.

31-Oct-03 CHANGE: got a saved game from Wolfgang Rufeger which crashed
               upon electrifying tracks. Reason for the crash: the track

               added an error check to rail block electrification
               routine - this at least avoids the crash, but it'd be

          CHANGE: Some config files now get closed immediately after

04-Sep-03 FIX: Another fix to load saved games with convois without
               vehicles but a schedule which are sometimes created by
               Volkers new depot code. Thanks go to Manfred Duesing
               for providing a saved game to reproduce this bug!

          CHANGE: risen height value range for heightfields from
                  from -5...1  to -14...10

          CHANGE: changed city building code to keep up with high
                  growth factors. It was reported that the old code
                  had problems with factory above +4, the new code
                  should work well with higher factors, too

03-Sep-03 FIX: Fixed a type/range problem in getting heights from the
               map datastructure. This bug caused various height-related
               problems, including a crash if land was risen above 7

26-Aug-03 FIX: Got a saved game where convois had insanely high wait
               lock values. I don't know how that could happen -
               anyway the locks now have an upper bound of 1023
               so that sooner or later such convois start to move
               again.

          CHANGE: Changed a potentially insecure instruction order
                  in removing convois via the emergency button.
                  Crashes have been reported, but couldn't be reproduced.
                  I still hope this change will help.

          CHANGE: Reduced vehicle waiting time by another 5%

23-Aug-03 FIX: Labels/signs now appear centered in 128x128 tile mode,
               too.

          CHANGE: Modified memory management: risen basic block size
                  of pools to 16384 entries (had been 1024 before)
                  This speeds up both allocation and deallocation
                  of pooled objects. The overhead of partly used pools
                  is small compared to Simutrans' overall memory
                  consumption. (Currently this particularly speeds
                  up map destruction, an operation that is performed
                  before creating a new map, loading a new game and
                  before quitting Simutrans).

21-Aug-03 FIX: Hajo: it seems Volkers new depot code sometimes saves
               convois without any vehicles. But Simutrans can't load
               them afterwards and crashes upon loading such a saved
               game. I've implemented a workaround that allows to
               load such games again, but I think this needs further
               investigation and testing.

          FIX: Fixed a temporary inconsistency of convoi data that
               lead to serious problems with the new reduced waiting
               time for vehicles.

20-Aug-03 FIX: Removing a mail office now resets a stations ability
               to collect, store and move mail.

          FIX: Car factory had input capacity 0/0t plastics. I'm not
               sure if this affected the game at all, but it's now
               set to 0/300t

          CHANGE: Only one mail office per station allowed

          CHANGE: Reduced overall loading time of vehicles. Trucks,
                  busses and ships now need about 2 seconds to load,
                  trains need 2 + (number_of_waggons/4) seconds to
                  load. -> If you have a slow computer and Simutrans
                  is near the max CPU power already, the vehicle
                  loading times will grow. Try the -refresh n switch
                  in that case (see readme.txt for details).

          FIX: Fixed a 'race condition' in world destruction.
               In rare occasions, there was step() called on cities
               that just underwent destruction.

          CHANGE: lowered passenger rate for higher level buildings

27-Jul-03 NEW: UI button class got a tooltip feature. Added tooltips to
               some buttons that didn't have a meaningful label

          NEW: Passenger statistics for stations (happy, unhappy, no
               route found). Newly created passengers become unhappy
               if their chosen starting station has more than 64
               passengers per segment already waiting there. Unhappy
               passengers will not use your transport service.
               "No route" in this case means that a passenger came to
               the station, couldn't find a route to his desired
               destination and went home.

          FIX: Using the emergency button to remove vehicles now resets
               the rail block counters if the vehicle was a train

          NEW: tooltips for tool selection windows

22-Jul-03 FIX: Screenshot directory is now created with correct
               access permissions under Linux

          FIX: all 16 player color sets are loaded correctly again

          FIX: Fixed two minor bugs in world map creation that caused
               trouble if the water level was changed from default level

20-Jul-03 CHANGE: Continued work on artificial slopes - created menu icons
                  and added slope tools to raise and lower land.

          NEW: Textures for slope support walls

          NEW: Added loading and saving of artificial slopes.

          FIX: Fixed a bug in heightfield loading (wrong filename suffix)
               (Heightfields are still searched in the "save" directory)

19-Jul-03 CHANGE: Continued work on artificial slopes - completed slope
                  table, created a menu and tools

17-Jul-03 CHANGE: Continued work on artificial slopes - painted slope
                  cut walls and implemented first version of slope
                  mapping table.

16-Jul-03 CHANGE: Changed grid heights to sint8. This saves 65k
                  for a standard 256x256 map

          CHANGE: Continued work on artificial slopes - grounds now
                  have up to three images: artificial walls, the ground
                  itself and a way image (this takes additional 128k
                  of memory for a standard 256x256 map)

14-Jul-03 NEW: Started to work on artificial slopes

13-Jul-03 FIX: Fixed a bug in AI code that could crash the game if the
               AI was searching for suitable places to build a station
               near the map border

          CHANGE: Private cars speed risen to 60 km/h

12-Jul-03 CHANGE: Enlarged text buffer for convoi info window from 16k
                  to 32k

          CHANGE: Lowered passenger generation at tourist attractions by
                  20%

          CHANGE: Included Tomas Kubes' sawmill in 64x64 image set

          NEW: Added emergency button to vehicle info window - it removes
               the vehicle from the map. This is useful to get rid of
               stuck vehicles. Be careful: the removed vehicle is gone
               forever! The button is labelled "X".

          NEW: AI will now remove vehicles if they have no suitable
               route (anymore) - i.e. due to a bug or player sabotage.

09-Jul-03 FIX: Tourist attractions are valid passenger destinations
               again - formerly this information was lost after
               loading a saved game

          FIX: Fixed bug in tourist attraction buildings own tourist
               generation code ... sometimes they produced insane amounts
               of tourists, followed by periods of no production at all.
               Generation rate is now set to 82 passengers per minute
               for perfect destination coverage (I never reached more than
               30% coverage so far).


07-Jul-03 FIX: Fixed a bug in payment calculation while waiting for a
               given loading level (i.e. wait for 100%).

          CHANGE: During my tests it seems that maintenance costs are
                  much too low. Thus I've doubled all maintenance costs.
                  -> this is also an incentive to use ships. Unlike rails
                  and roads, water doesn't need maintenance :)

          NOTE: Due to the changed payment calculation (introduced in
                0.82.0exp), passenger transport gives higher revenues
                now. Maybe further adaptations must be made, but the
                new calculation scheme is correct, while the old scheme
                was wrong.

06-Jul-03 FIX: Compressed savegames work reliably now. (See simuconf.tab
               for details)

          CHANGE: Changed income calculation: now on every stop income
                  is calculated for all transported goods, based on the
                  distance since the last stop.

                  Before, it happened that goods that stayed in the
                  vehicle for several stops, only paid the last hop,
                  instead of the full distance.

          CHANGE: Lowered (to 25%) amount of passengers generated at
                  tourist attractions. Now up to 42 passengers are
                  generated per minute (less if the player has not 100%
                  destination coverage).

28-Jun-03 Changes by Volker:

          CHANGE: New path structure - subfolders font, palette, save and
                  screenshot are now used. Starting the new game will
                  create them automatically and move the files there.
                  Be careful: an old version will not find them afterwards.

          NEW: More work on new depot dialog (resizeable etc.)

          NEW: Speedbar for vehicles

          CHANGE: Removed old code - this can only read games saved with
                  the prev. version.

          NEW: Savegames are now zipped by default - loading autodetects
               the savegame type.
               (Hajo: doesn't work on my system. Default seems to be set to
                binary, not zipped. Forcing zipped mode causes a crash).

          CHANGE: Trees are displayed small in hide-buildings-mode

          NEW: When using commandline "-load <savegame>" the extension
               needs no longer be supplied.

???       CHANGE: industry distribution now generates larger average
                  distances between industries

21-Jun-03 CHANGE: continued work on new vehicles and pathfinding

20-Jun-03 CHANGE: continued work on new vehicles and pathfinding

19-Jun-03 CHANGE: continued work on new vehicles and pathfinding

18-Jun-03 CHANGE: continued work on new vehicles and pathfinding

17-Jun-03 NEW: started to work on a new vehicle class that implements
               a different, more flexible pathfinding method


About 0.82.pre1

This version is really just a preview. Volker told me he will further
improve the depot dialog, but you can already try it a bit.
Also Volker made a lot of internal changes that can affect stability
but we hope that overall they will help  further development. A few
minor bug fixes are also included.

You can use this version with the 0.81.35exp base package.


14-Jun-03 FIX: fixed a bug in player color tables (green color set
               got wrong values due to some wrong index calculations)
          FIX: fixed ground water level calculation in zoom modes
               with a raster width of less than 64
          FIX: bridges can now be built on electrified track
          CHANGE: included Volkers changes (lots ... most notably the new
                  depot window)

09-Jun-03 CHANGE: support for unzoomable images (icons ...)
                  adapted MakeObj, display routines and dat files
                  -> if image names in .dat files are prefixed with
                  "> " they will not get zoomed in the game
                  -> IMPORTANT NOTE: this changes makes all previous
                  PAK files incompatible!!!

07-Jun-03 FIX: player color table initialisation wasn't executed
               after starting a new game. Table now gets initialised
               always.

29-May-03 CHANGE: enhanced MakeObj and Simutrans to use 7 shades of
                  player colors (instead of 4). Also there are now 9
                  reserved player colors that can be used for future
                  expansions
          -> This change introduces a slight incompatibility with old
             saved games. The player color settings will most likely
             become reset to color set 0 if loading an old game, some
             times a random other set can be chosen. This means you'll
             most likely have to choose your preferred color set again.

25-May-03 released 0.81.33exp

24-May-03 FIX: tourist generation now depends on real time (formerly
               it depended on simloops, but simloops vary too much to
               be a reliable measure)
          NEW: factory window now displays the category of produced
               goods if they are categorized goods

15-May-03 NEW: added category for cooled goods (category 4)
          CHANGE: changed calculation of town growth a bit
                  (towns grow slower now)
          CHANGE: zoom level can now be changed by "page up"
                  "page down" keys, too. (Zooming quality is still bad)

11-May-03 NEW: translations are now read from 'text' subdirectory.
               Simutrans can now read up to 40 translation files.
               Thanks to Adam Barclay for this nice addition.

08-May-03 CHANGE: cursor keys now scroll map, too

25-Apr-03 FIX: traced Simutrans for memory leaks and accesses of/to
               uninitialised memory

21-Apr-03 CHANGE: optimized some graphics routines (5% faster now)

20-Apr-03 CHANGE: reduced number of malloc()/free() calls for loading
                  trees and buildings (-> games should load a bit faster
                  now)

19-Apr-03 FIX: fixed a crash if the player or AI scheduled a new vehicle

18-Apr-03 FIX: after a schedule is changed, freight to stations that are
               no longer included in the schedule is removed from the
               vehicle
          FIX: saved games in which factories have negative amounts
               of input stored are now repaired (amount set to 0)
               upon loading. Also factories that have more than 15000
               units of input are clipped to 15000 units.

15-Apr-03 FIX: fixed a memory leak in slist_tpl/nodelist

08-Apr-03 FIX: goods distribution didn't consider multiple destinations
               per station properly. This should be fixed now.

05-Apr-03 CHANGE: factories now distribute goods always to that station
                  that currently has the least amount of that good stored
          CHANGE: reduced vehicle waiting time at stations by 15% in
                  average. Unfortunately the waiting times vary strongly.
          CHANGE: improved shores images a bit
          FIX:    tried to fix a bug in the AI code that sometimes created
                  train stations with defective last tiles and then placed
                  trains on those defective tiles with the effect that
                  those trains never could move

29-Mar-03 CHANGE: removed last dependency to ADT package

23-Mar-03 CHANGE: optimized map lookup

22-Mar-03 CHANGE: optimized goods routing

21-Mar-03 CHANGE: optimized goods routing

20-Mar-03 CHANGE: optimized vehicle routing

          CHANGE: optimized routing of goods and passengers

16-Mar-03 CHANGE: changed ownership (player) management for things
          CHANGE: tried to reduce memory consumption, saved 8 bytes
                  per map square that has no bridge or tunnel
                  -> risen max map size to 768 for that people with
                     powerful computers.
          FIX: fixed a potential buffer overflow in minivec_tpl
          FIX: fixed a potential buffer overflow in microvec_tpl

15-Mar-03 NEW: included Matthews changes for "min size" window gadget
          NEW: "new map" dialog now gives estimated memory requirement
               for chosen map size
          NEW: included 4 types of variant grass to break the uniformity
               if the landscape

26-Feb-03 CHANGE: finance window now formats money as 1.000,00
          FIX: negative total balance is now displayed in red

23-Feb-03 NEW: number of transported passengers now influences city growth
               (see +X in city info window. +1 means doubled growth, +2 means
               tripled growth rate. Will always be 0 after loading a new game
               and midnights. Needs a while to be recalculated.)
          NEW: new industry branch 'gasoline production'
          NEW: included Alberto Beccarias updated italian translation
          CHANGE: reenabled display/brightness control.
                  Range is now -8 ... 0
                  0 being the brightest setting. 0 is default value.
          CHANGE: slightly risen the average distance of industries
          CHANGE: made church a special building
          released unofficial 0.81.23exp

               than two <a href=""></a> tags were included in the help text
          FIX: included Alberto Beccaria as italian translator into the
               intro scroller
          FIX: fixed a bug in image zooming if going back to zoom factor 1
          CHANGE: included new help texts by Adam Barclay

???       Stopped development of zooming feature. Need to wait for
          Volkers new MakeObj with more flags for images (unzoomable
          images -> currently icons and other menu-images get zoomed, too).
          Very simple (fast) zoom routine is working now, zoom quality
          is bad.

12-Feb-03 NEW: continued to work on zooming feature

11-Feb-03 NEW: continued to work on zooming feature

10-Feb-03 NEW: started to work on zooming feature (use > and < keys to zoom
               in and out)

09-Feb-03 NEW: added legend to relief map window
          CHANGE: included Tomas Kubes' new english city name syllables
                  in en.tab
          CHANGE: performance tuning
               - changed route_t and vector_tpl index parameters to
                 unsigned, saving one if conditional on each access
          released unofficial 0.81.22exp

08-Feb-03 NEW: player starting money can now be configured in
               simuconf.tab
          NEW: factories now require different amounts of input to produce
               goods. I.e. to produce one ton of iron 2 tons of iron ore
               and 0.5 tons or coal are required
          CHANGE: included Tomas Kubes' new darkening (night mode) code
          FIX: fixed a wrong gridded grass tile that appeared to be
               invisible
          FIX: fixed landscape pointer position calculation in 128x128
               tile mode
          FIX: fixed refresh area for landscape pointer movement in
               128x128 tile mode
          FIX: level crossing only can be build on empty squares
               (this prevents a crash if you built them while a vehicle was
               passing this square)
          FIX: fixed input overflow problem in factories

06-Feb-03 CHANGE: more performance tuning
                  - optimized dingliste bei(n) now takes an unsigned
                    parameter, saving one if conditional
                  - changed array_tpl and array2d_tpl parameters to
                    to unsigned, saving one (two) if conditionals on each
                    element access

05-Feb-03 CHANGE: more performance tuning
                  - inlined ist_bruecke und ist_tunnel, added flags
                    to grund_t
                  - changed minivec get() parameter to unsigned,
                    this saves one if condition
                  - removed one if from karte_vollansicht_t::display_dinge
                  - removed one if from grund_t::display_dinge
                  - removed one if condition and one assignment from
                    karte_t::sync_step
                  - inlined grund_t::gib_weg, and optimized the routine
                    slightly

04-Feb-03 CHANGE: tried to reduce the memory consumption - reduced by 8 bytes
                  per ground.
          CHANGE: tried to optimize pedestrian routines
          CHANGE: profiling and overall performance tuning

               switch the grid on/off.

27-Jan-03 NEW: finished buttons for the factory info window to jump to
               consumers, also added buttons to jump to the workers home

                     a private car had gone more than 2**31 steps
          FIX: fixed overhead line images for diagonal track
          NEW: started work on line (route) management

20-Jan-03 CHANGE/FIX: also doubled running cost for 'Bennhardt' engines
                  (had been overlooked yesterday)
          NEW: added Colins hong kong ferries
          NEW: added Bens industrial city buildings

19-Jan-03 FIX: fixed dat file entry for "large office building (by Trikky)"
          FIX: sand truck can now be used without trailer

                  and a whole lot CPU time plus memory bandwidth!)
          CHANGE: changed "Passenger %" for monuments from 150 to 60

          CHANGE: rose starting money to 150000 Cr
          CHANGE: newly generated passengers will not use stations
                  where more than 64 passengers per square are already
                  waiting
                  Note: workers nevertheless use crowded stations!
          CHANGE: reduced passenger generation ratio from (building_level+2)
                  to (building_level+4)/2   ->  that is roughly the same
                  as before for low-level buildings, but only have of the
                  former rate for high-level buildings

          FIX: Ships can now be sent to depots again
          FIX: fixed a bug in restoring overhead line images when loading
               games that had been saved under a different OS or with a
               different set of PAK files - this also saves 4 bytes
               per saved overhead line tile

17-Jan-03 FIX: made some bugfixes for new bigtile mode
          FIX: fixed a bug in overhead line y-offset calculation that
               made overhead tiles on bridge ends move higher and higher
               if the overhead lines were re-built (again)
          NEW: added automatic tile size detection (PAK files reader)
               -> requires at least one full width image in tile set
          NEW: linked lists now allocate nodes from a pool. Slightly faster
               than before and conserves a little bit of memory
          CHANGE: changed toolbar window to work with 128 and 64 pak files
          CHANGE: additional station segments only cost half of a new segment
          CHANGE: new station segments now cost 2400Cr

          FIX: fixed a basement image which seems to have been damaged
               during the conversion to the new multi-pak file approach.

08-Jan-03 FIX: fixed a bug that sometimes move the city area out of map
               bounds if a town hall was renewed
          FIX: added correction code to read games with towns that suffer
               from the above mentioned problem

                  pedestrians there
          NEW: added monument inscriptions to en.tab

          FIX: removed extraneous second 'dock' button from ship tools menu

03-Jan-03 CHANGE: tried to reduce jitter in vehicle movement
          CHANGE: tried to optimize the updates of trees, buildings etc.
                  overall this should help to run larger games, but I
                  don't know how much improvement it will bring.
          FIX: fixed steel truck and steel trailer images which
               seem to have been damaged during the conversion to the

11-Dec-02 NEW: non-station buildings can be hidden from display by pressing
               " (Shift-2 on a german keyboard). This is useful if large
               buildings block sight to something important.
          NEW: started to work on electrified, monorail and maglev track types
               electrified tracks work already, yet they still look the same
               as ordinary tracks

07-Dec-02 CHANGE: changed capacities:
                  Furniture wagon:  20 crates

17-Nov-02 FIX: fixed some bugs in routing of goods (broken during changes
               for categorized goods)
          BUG: Station list filter for incoming/outgoing goods might work
               differently than before. I never used it, so my change is just
               a guess
          released unofficial 0.81.9exp

16-Nov-02 NEW: enlarged schedule window
          CHANGE: goods are now grouped into unique goods, parcel service and
                  bulk goods. Vehicles that transport goods of the categories
                  parcel and bulk goods can now transport _any_ good of those
                  categories. I.e. a coal car can now also be used to
                  transport iron ore.

                  Parcel service: Books, Furniture
                  Bulk goods:     Sand, Stone, Coal, Iron Ore

                  Due to this change the savegame format became incompatible.
                  Sorry, no conversion is possible, even some of the pak files
                  now have a different structure.
          CHANGE: enlarged text buffer for vehicle information window to
                  reduce the danger of buffer overruns

26-Oct-02 FIX: After schedule changes, no-longer existing routes are
               checked and waiting goods are cleaned up. This should
               fix the long-standing bug that passengers and goods
               waited endlessly after a route was shut down and/or
               replaced by another route.
               This cleanup action is pretty time consuming. In games
               with many stations and vehicles, running on slow computers
               this will take several seconds to complete.
          released unofficial 0.81.8exp

               after 0.81.0)

19-Oct-02 FIX: fixed a bug in loading saved games (height information
               was accessed before actually loaded)

               bridges in unsuitable locations and ended up with broken
               routes)

12-Oct-02 FIX: random pedestrians can now actually be turned on and off
               in simuconf.tab

               visiting a depot without disassembling the convoi

          CHANGE: relief map is now zoomable: right click into map to

          CHANGE: made info windows for pedestrians and private cars
                  configurable in simuconf.tab

          NEW: water (ground) animation can now be turned off in
               simuconf.tab (i.e. if you have a slow CPU and want to save
               some computation time for other tasks)
               They serve some useful purpose, though: the more you see
               around a spot, the better the place to build a station there.
          NEW: player/AI colors can now be configured by editing the file
               "special.pal" which is a text file containing 64 RGB colors
               in decimal values
          FIX: loading pedestrians works now
          FIX: fixed some problems in day&night mode:

               2) window title bars don't darken during nights
          CLEAN: did some more code cleanup in simgraph16.c
          CHANGE: interrupt routine now updates display first and then
                  calculates next frame - i hope this will reduce the
                  jitter in vehicle movement
          CHANGE: changed sync_step routine to be (hopefully) faster and
                  more robust against the most common coding mistakes
                  (deleting/removing a sync object while a sync step is
                  running).

          CHANGE: updated thanks.txt

02-Sep-02 CHANGE: changed layout of the ship depot. It looks a bit better
                  than before, but some ships are just too oversized - why
                  don't the artists follow the size guidelines?

                  to a more efficient variant
          CHANGE: removed brightness and contrast control from the
                  display options dialog because they didn't work anymore
                  since the transition to the 16 bit graphics code and
                  those features most likely won't be implemented again.
          CHANGE: declared savegames previous to 0.80.10 incompatible
                  because some vehicles couldn't be restored from such
                  savegames properly.

         TIME: 1:30h

07/01/02 - FIX: fixed a bug in Markus' patch for the depot window - when
                buying a new vehicle the cost of a lot of different vehicles
                was also withdrawn from the players account.
         - released unofficial 0.80.9a-16exp

06/30/02 - FIX: maintenance cost is now actually subtracted from players

                - each building: 50.00 Cr/month
                (There is a small bug here: ATM oil rigs belong to the player,
                and thus the player has to pay maintenance costs for them).

         - MERGE: merged Markus patch to display only matching carriages
                  in the depot window

                  - existing screenshots are preserved, new screenshots

                   1024x768 and 1280x1024 in fullscreen. Use the -screensize

                   resolution.

                that was required by depot.tab
         TIME: 1:00h

01/27/02 - CHANGE: Made convoi route preparation also an
                   asynchronous task.
         - CHANGE: Because asynchronous tasks take longer to execute,
                   vehicles stop longer at stations than before.
                   To rebalance the game, the productivity of all industries
                   was reduced by 10%.
         - CHANGE: Due to the new asynchronous parts in convoi setup
                   vehicles may remain much longer in a inconsistent state.
                   That problem is solved now.
         - NEW: released unofficial version 0.80.pre3
         TIME: 2:00h

                   vehicle movement.
         TIME: 3:30h

01/24/02 - FIX: Fixed some bugs in asynchronous vehicle loading code.
                Overall asynchronous loading seems to allow to use quite
                some more vehicles than before.
         - FIX: Improved responsiveness to user input under high load.
         TIME: 2:00h

01/23/02 - FIX: Debugging
         - CHANGE: Made vehicle loading an asynchronous task.
         - CHANGE: Passengers and goods transfer at most 30 times from
                   one transport to another to reach their destination.
         TIME: 2:00h

01/20/02 - CHANGE: Saved 8k memory per convoi.
         - CHANGE: Saved 8k memory per station.
         - CHANGE: Included a change from Markus Weber to display summary
                   information in station info windows.
         - CHANGE: Changed layout of vehicle list to display vehicle
                   with 3 figures (100+) better.
         - CHANGE: Using memory pools for water grounds - this saves 4 bytes
                   per water square and speeds up allocation and deallocation
                   of water grounds. It also helps to reduce memory
                   fragmentation.
         - FIX: Fixed a possible buffer overflow in halt list.
         - FIX: Included a fix for setting the correct water level during
                loading a game.
         - NEW: released unofficial version 0.80.pre2
         TIME: 3:00h

01/19/02 - FIX: Fixed a bug in clipped 16 bit image display routines
         - FIX: Fixed a bug in SDL sound routines that caused a crash
                in the windows version
         - FIX: Fixed a possible buffer overflow in route calculation of
                goods and passengers.
         - NEW: Fullscreen mode for Linux/SDL in 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768
                and 1280x1024 (The Windows version always offered those as

         TIME: 3:00h

01/16/02 - FIX: Fixed a bug that crashed Simutrans if the player managed to
                delete/destroy a private car.
         - NEW: Makepak16 reads 8/16/24 bit PNG files now.
         TIME: 1:00h

01/13/02 - MERGE: Andreas Rövers sound routines for SDL
         - TEST: Tested Simutrans with SDL 1.2
         - NEW: updated 16 bit graphics routines (not complete yet)
         TIME: 4:00h

01/12/02 - NEW: -scenario <directory> option to make Simutrans read
                config files and daten.pak from that directory.
         TIME: 3:00h

                     vertically resized now
         - CHANGE: changed look of resizer component to better fit the other
                   gui components of Simutrans
         - NEW: released unofficial version 0.80.pre1
         TIME: 1:00h

01/08/02 - FIX: automated test suite works again (was broken since Volkers
                changes during summer/autumn last year).
         - FIX: cities generate passengers to 2x2 squares sized tourist
                attractions, too.
         - CHANGE: using memory pools for trees - this saves 4 bytes per
                   tree and speeds up allocation and deallocation of tress.
                   It also helps to reduce memory fragmentation.
         - CHANGE: did some finetuning to make the framerate more constant
         - MERGE: include Markus' new station list window and button
         TIME: 5:00h

01/02/02 - MERGE: merged Volkers changes
                  - Shift-M opens marker UI
                  - Removing a bus stop from a square with a sidewalk
                    keeps the sidewalk
                  - Bugfixes for bridges and tunnels
                  - Code cleanups
         - CHANGE: changed layout of the "options" dialog
         - CHANGE: changed layout of the "new world" dialog
         TIME: 2:30h

12/28/01 - CHANGE: Reverted some changes made by Volker:
                   - city roads belong to nobody again
                   - a square that the player builds a road or railroad on
                     and that had no former owner belongs to the player again
                   -> That fixes the 'bus station on city roads' problem
         - FIX: Included a bugfix from Volker to make bridges work again.
                It seems to work.
         - FIX: Added missing screen refresh after removing a long bridge
         TIME: 1:30h

12/20/01 - FIX: Trains can now be stopped while passing signals without bad
                effects, like corrupted signals and disrupted trains.
         - CHANGE: Reduced productivity of coal mines and oil fields.
         - Released unofficial version 0.79.11exp
         TIME: 2:00h

12/19/01 - CHANGE: Removed 'passenger X%' from industry info window
         - MERGE: Merged Volkers changes -> Bridges no longer need 'hills'
                  to start/end but can be built on flat ground, too.
         - FIX: Goods with "error in routing", that means they cannot reach
                their destination any longer, are now removed from stations
                after a while. They are also removed from vehicles upon the
                next scheduled stop.
         - FIX: Fixed a bug in the AI code that sometimes prohibited the use
                of tunnels in the AIs routes
         - FIX: Partly loaded vehicles display the loaded/empty cars now.
         - NEW: Option in the schedule dialog to set a required loading grade.
                Vehicles can now wait for a minimum amount of loaded goods
                before departing.
         TIME: 6:30h

         TIME: 1:10h

12/15/01 - CHANGE: prepared Makepak 1.07 for release
         TIME: 0:30h

12/12/01 - FIX: I got two savegames from beta testers that had an animation
                count of 0 for some factory buildings. That count should
                never be 0, even a non-animated building has a least one
                frame (image) to display. During loading of a game the
                count gets now set to 1, but how could there a 0 be saved?
                The 0 caused a crash after loading the game, so this 'fix'
                at least allows to load the saved games again.
         - FIX: fixed a crash after clicking the bridgebuilding tool twice
         - FIX: fixed a small display problem in the news ticker line
         - CHANGE: Changed lower bound of frame time to 28ms, this yields
                   a frame rate of 35FPS which should be smooth display.
         - Released unofficial version 0.79.9exp
         TIME: 1:30h

12/09/01 - FIX: Passenger generation in cities is now bound to real time.
                I had wrongly assumed that the simulation loop is running
                always at the same speed but it varies too much. Now,
                passenger generation tends to be lower in the average case
                but it is constant regardless of your computers speed.
         - FIX: Volkers changes prevented the AI to build tunnels and
                bridges. I've repaired the AI's road/railroad building
                routines. I hope it works all ok again.
         - FIX: Newly built stations display world view camera, too.
         - CHANGE: Changed layout in station info and convoi info windows.
         - CHANGE: Optimized month change in city class.
         - CHANGE: Optimized routing of goods.
         - CHANGE: Optimized routing of vehicles.
         - CHANGE: Tried to reduce the jitter in frame rate. Frame time
                   has now a lower bound of 30ms and a higher bound of 124ms.
                   Interrupt checks were added to ensure a jitter of less than
                   5 ms in frame display; I've tested this on my system, slower
                   systems might still have a larger jitter. (Timer precision
                   is 5 ms, that means, the current jitter is below timer
                   precision, more precision is impossible with this timer).
         - CHANGE: Waiting goods and passengers at station search a new route
                   now and then. This is useful if a new shorter connection is
                   build and the waiting goods/passengers are supposed to use
                   it.
         - Released unofficial 0.79.8exp

                   - FIX: Unmasked ribis for ways were determined wrong
         - CHANGE: Tried to optimize Simutrans further but gained less than
                   1% overall
         - CHANGE: Changed news ticker to store only 4 messages instead of 10
         - CHANGE: Increased capacity of furniture truck to 8 crates
                   Increased capacity of furniture trailer to 10 crates
         - NEW: Included Jens 'JET wood trailer'
         - FIX: Changed some code in station info display to fix a buffer
                overflow.
         - FIX: Changed some code in vehicle info display to fix a buffer
                overflow.
         TIME: 2:00h

12/05/01 - CHANGE: changed some return types from value types to
                   references. This seems to speed up execution.
         TIME: 1:00h

12/01/01 - FIX: oil rigs can no longer be removed using the 'raise land'
                tool.
         - FIX: oil rigs display a station info window again.
         - FIX: Fixed a bug that caused some landscape pointers to be
                displayed at wrong height
         - FIX: Fixed a bug that caused landscape pointers to be
                displayed twice
         - NEW: 'Game paused' splash message
         - NEW: Included Flor Wauters furniture trailer
         - CHANGE: reduced memory consumption of each water square by 4 bytes.
         - CHANGE: optimized screen refresh, gained about 10% speedup if
                   many vehicles are visible
         TIME: 5:00h

11/29/01 - FIX: if the remover tool is applied to water, the water itself
                no longer gets removed
         - CHANGE: changed tree class to reduce the amount of memory modified
                   per step
         TIME: 1:30h

11/28/01 - CHANGE: made mountain height and landscape roughness
                   parametrizeable for Markus' new 'new world' dialog
         TIME: 0:45h

11/26/01 - FIX: fixed a crash if the bus station building tool was selected
         - FIX: included a fix from Volker: if a signals was to near to a
                crossing the rail block was not correctly traversed. Volkers
                change should fix that problem.
         - FIX: fixed a potential crash during map creation (placing power-
                connector for power plant sometimes failed. This is not fixed
                really, problematic power plants will just get no power
                connector. I'll change that once powerlines actually work )
         - CHANGE: "Vehicle XY has no route" is only displayed for vehicles
                   which the player actually owns.
         - CHANGE: Factory info window now carries the name of the industry
                   as title.
         - PROBLEM: with the change from static to animated buildings the
                    title of most building info windows changed from
                    'building' to 'house'.
         - Released unofficial 0.79.7exp
         TIME: 1:30h

11/25/01 - CHANGE: only wagons inside of a stations will be loaded/unloaded
         - CHANGE: loading/unloading has a base duration (32) and an additional
                   duration for each wagon (8)
         - CHANGE: internal change: replaced many old 2d coordinates in
                   paramterlists with 3d coordinates.
         - CHANGE: Added "Station XY is crowded" message to the newsticker
         - CHANGE: Factories don't check stations for good distribution
                   as often. This should speed up the program.
         - FIX: rail block is marked 'left' if a train enters a depot
         - FIX: added missing screen refresh when saving a game per name
         - FIX: fixed a bug in blockmanager, which could cause and endless
                loop during world destruction
         - FIX: fixed several bugs in handle_as_id_tpl which caused crashes
         - FIX: fixed a crash when a vehicle with freight was sent to a depot
                and re-assigned to another convoi.
         - Released unofficial 0.79.6exp
         TIME: 8:00h

11/24/01 - NEW: minivec template, a very small vector type.
         - CHANGE: Reworked plan squares to use minivec type instead of a
                   list type to store grounds. This saves at least 512K
                   memory for a standard 256x256 squares map. In addition
                   accesses should be faster now.
         - CHANGE: Removed an unused variable from ground class. It seems
                   it was introduced by Volkers changes but actually not
                   used. This saves 512K for a standard 256x256 square map.
         - CHANGE: Reordered variables in ground class, which saved another
                   4 bytes per ground. Why is the compiler too stupid to do
                   this automatically?
         - CHANGE: Squeezed 4 bytes from every object of the thing class
                   hierarchy (most numerous objects in Simutrans). This
                   also shrinks the saved games.
         - CHANGE: Linked list templates now use a global list of free nodes.
                   This shrinks each list object by 4 bytes, and it speeds
                   up node allocation.
         - CHANGE: Depot window class and depot data class are now separated.
         - CHANGE: Code cleanup, reduced interdependencies of header files
         - CHANGE: Improved look of info windows
         - NEW: experimental support for multi-headed engines
         TIME: 6:15h


11/22/01 - CHANGE: Removed superclass infowin_t from weg_t. It was
                   not needed and just consumed memory.
         - CHANGE: Removed superclass infowin_t from ding_t. It was
                   not needed and just consumed memory.
         - NEW: Thing info window adapter class
         - CHANGE: Started to separate depot gui and depot model classes
         TIME: 2:10h


11/20/01 - NEW: Ground info window adapter class
         - CHANGE: Changed class hierarchy of ground classes to be
                   independent from info window class
                   -> this allows inlining of some functions and thus
                      speeds up some things (3% speedup overall).
         - FIX: Info windows display correct ground name again, this
                feature was lost during Volkers changes.
         - FIX: Fixed a bug that crashed Simutrans if a ground was removed
                while the info window for this ground was still open. This
                also fixes a similar bug for things that are removed.
         TIME: 1:10h

11/18/01 - NEW: New engine: Tigress I (1144-1151)
         - CHANGE: Code cleanup
         - CHANGE: Trees are now generated according to their preferred
                   placement on new maps. Some prefer lower terrain, some
                   prefer the upper regions.
         - CHANGE: Trees generate up to three new trees during their lifetime.
                   Formerly depending on the system Simutrans was running on
                   sometimes much too many new trees were generated.
         - NEW: news ticker
         - CHANGE: Some smaller optimizations, avoided function calls,
                   about 4% speedup in total for games with many vehicles
         TIME: 6:30h

11/17/01 - CHANGE: Merged Andreas' changes:
                   - If a new schedule is set, only those goods are
                     removed from a vehicle which cannot reach their
                     destination anymore. Formerly all goods were removed.
         - CHANGE: Merged Markus' changes:
                   - Ok and Cancel buttons for savegame file chooser. The
                     new savegame chooser looks really cool :)
         - CHANGE: Merged Volkers changes:
                   - fixed a small flaw in hashtable datatype
                   - new class to load *.tab files, this loader should become
                     standard in future for all *.tab files
                   - new integer hashtable template
                   - new bridgebuilder class which is responsible for
                     building and removing bridges
                   - New bridge types, new bridge building menu
                   - Changes to pointer checking and memory management
         - CHANGE: Added comments for all methods of the convoi class
         - FIX: fixed a bug that left copies of the landscape pointer
                image visible when moving the landscape point uphill or
                downhill
         - CHANGE: Sped up routing (pathfinding) of goods, this allows to
                   use larger transport networks
         - CHANGE: Routing of goods cannot be interrupted anymore
                   this fixes a potential bug in routing, but also may
                   cause a slowdown in really large games. I hope that
                   the optimization of routing will reduce this problem.
         TIME: 4:30h

11/14/01 - NEW: Merged Markus Webers changes to the Simutrans UI
         - NEW: Merged Andreas' changes to the SDL system wrapper file
         - CHANGE: limited 'random map' to 0-999
         - CHANGE: system wrapper can now choose between software or
                   hardware cursor. Currently Allegro uses software
                   cursor, SDL and X11 use hardware cursor.
         TIME: 1:15h

11/13/01 - FIX: fixed a bug in removing railroad tracks, which sneaked in
                with Andreas' changes
         - NEW: released unofficial 0.79.4exp
         TIME: 1:00h

11/12/01 - FIX: fixed a memory leak that sneaked in while optimizing
                vehicle routing
         - NEW: released unofficial 0.79.3exp
         TIME: 1:00h

11/11/01 - CHANGE: STL priority queue can't be used with Mingw32. Using
                   self made priority queue.
         - FIX: fixed a bug in routing. The bug limited the usable distance
                of routes for all vehicles, and slowed routing down,
                especially if ships were routed.
         - CHANGE: changed routing of goods. It had a similar bug like
                   routing of ships. I hope this change didn't break
                   something. If it works it'll speed up routing of goods
                   in complex networks quite a bit.
         - CHANGE: added tooltips for all tools of the toolbar
         - CHANGE: tripled text buffer size for station info. There were
                   problems reported which might be related to a buffer
                   overflow in station info display. New buffer size is
                   8192 bytes. Mingw32 does not support snprintf(), but with
                   sprintf() I have no idea how to avoid buffer overflows.
                   I just hope 12288 bytes is big enough.
         - CHANGE: doubled buffer size of convoi info text, too, just to
                   be a bit more save. Now 8192 bytes buffer size.
         - CHANGE: included Flors updated drive in cinema
                   included Flors general purpose ship
                   included Flors updated furniture factory
                   included Flors updated home market
                   included Flors updated planks truck
         - CHANGE: included Volkers update:
                   FIX: image calculation of single rail pieces on slopes
                        fixed
                   FIX: some problems with directional bits in
                        rail block manager, simplified some code
                   FIX: fixed problems when removing bridges and tunnels
         TIME: 6:00h

11/10/01 - FIX: fixed a typo in de.tab
         - FIX: included Andreas' fix for wrong curves in tracks
         - FIX: included Andreas' fix to remove trees if land is lowered
         - CHANGE: switched to STL priority queue for vehicle routing, this
                   should speed routing up for long and complex routes, but
                   is somewhat slower for short routes
         - CHANGE: optimized vehicle routing, now about 20% faster than
                   before. This allows to use 20% more vehicles than
                   before! Changes due to the switch to the STL priority
                   queue are not included in this measurement.
         TIME: 3:00h

11/05/01 - CHANGE: included Tristans fixed vehikel.tab with better
                   weight and power values for trucks, busses and ships
         - CHANGE: changed vehicle info display in road vehicle depot
                   to display power and weight
         TIME: 0:15h

10/28/01 - CHANGE: changed vehicle routing. Fixed a bug in search for best
                   route. Vehicles should now always find the shortest route.
         - CHANGE: cities build a stadium at a population of 2500, was
                   formerly 2000.
         - NEW: cities build a drive in cinema at a population of 1500.
         - FIX: fixed a wrong entry in en.tab and de.tab
                ("Verkehrsteilnehmer")
         TIME: 3:00h

10/27/01 - FIX: removing ground from above tunnels works now
         - FIX: removing tunnels works now
         - FIX: removing bridges works now
         - CHANGE: removing bridges and tunnels no longer places rails
                   on the end squares, but cuts the rails at the end
                   of the former structure
         - CHANGE: added END markers to depot.tab sections and a check
                   if given vehicle count matches actual vehicle count.
         - CHANGE: updated thanks.txt
         - NEW: included Jens wood transport ship
         TIME: 2:30h

10/21/01 - CHANGE: changes savegame format to load/store animated factories
         - CHANGE: enlarged scroll range in vehicle and station info windows
         - NEW: included Flors animated factories
         - NEW: included Flors new trucks

10/15/01 - NEW: animated factories
         - CHANGE: better animation support for all buildings

10/12/01 - CHANGE: changed makepak to read PNG images, converted all
                   images to PNG format.

10/08/01 - NEW: added Flors new pause icon.
         - CHANGE: enlarged scrollable range in vehicle info windows

10/04/01 - FIX: if vehicles are stored in depots and the map was saved and
                loaded again, Simutrans crashed. This worked in former
                versions, I don't know why it was broken in between.
                Nevertheless this is fixed. (calc_bild() of the vehicle
                checked the ground of the map square which was not yet
                completely loaded at this moment, and this inconsistency
                made the game crash. Vehicles call calc_bild() often while
                moving. Theoretical there is a chance that the image of a
                vehicle is wrong now directly after loading, but I couldn't
                find any problems yet.
         - FIX: if a saved game from a Simutrans with a different vehicle.tab
                is loaded, some vehicle informations are not available.
                Formerly this caused a crash while loading the game. Now the
                information is replaced with 0 values. This has the result that
                the 'unknown' vehicles do not move (power and weight are set
                to 0), but the saved game can be loaded and all common vehicles
                (common in both vehicle.tab files from the saving and loading
                Simutrans) will work.
         - NEW: released unofficial 0.79.pre3

10/03/01 - FIX: fixed a buffer overflow in station name creation.
         - FIX: if the hardware clock is set back while Simutrans runs,
                the negative time difference is ignored.
           -> this change limits the time Simutrans can be run without stopping
              to about 23 days!
           -> this change saved 4 bytes memory in each goods-destination
              object both in main memory and saved games
         - FIX: due to Volkers changes, saved pedestrians didn't move anymore
                after loading. This is fixed, they move again.
         - NEW: The '!' key (Shift-1) toggles the display of station and
                town names.
         - NEW: The '.' and ',' keys can be used to change the time lapse
                setting. This is an experimental feature, if you want to
                be safe, do not use this.

09/30/01 - FIX: removing a building (or tree) sets ground to bare land
                (was broken due to Volkers changes)
         - FIX: factory owner is restored when loading a game
                (was broken due to Volkers changes)
         - FIX: vehicles are now displayed correctly (uncropped) again.
                (was broken due to Volkers changes)
           -> This fix does not work for vehicles on bridges, but since the
              problem only occurred with ships noticeably I think the fix is
              'good enough'. We have no ships on bridges so far.
         - CHANGE: conserved about 160KB for a standard size map save file
           -> This change limits the number of players to 127. I guess, this
              isn't really a restriction.
         - CHANGE: changed text for "optionen > quit" to "New map", because
                   it opens the new map dialog rather than quitting the
                   program.
         - CHANGE: changed image for "Please wait, creating a new map"
                   message window
         - NEW: released unofficial 0.79.pre2

09/29/01 - FIX: fixed a bug in Volker changes to routing; ships move again
           -> there is still a display problem in the graphics
         - FIX: if a text input field was active while the containing
                window is closed, the action bound to the input field is
                not triggered any more

09/26/01 - Merged Volkers changes
           -> binary save game format (saves about 30% space, saves and
              loads much faster, incompatible to previous versions)
           -> bugfixes for route calculation and object management in
              world map
         - FIX: fixed a problem in saving industries with Volkers new code:
                buildings no. 2 and 3 got mixed during saving
         - FIX: Volkers changes prohibited removing trees and town buildings
                It's now again possible to remove trees and houses
         - NEW: Released semi-official Simutrans version 0.79.pre1

09/23/01 - CHANGE: enabled producing industries to have more than one
                   consumer.
         - NEW: More than one consumer per producer. This finally overcomes
                the strict 1:1 relation of producers and consumers and allows
                more flexibility in the game.
         - CHANGE: modified buttons of the schedule input window to match
                   the look of most other buttons in Simutrans
         - FIX: fixed a display problem in train/convoi and station info
                windows

09/22/01 - CHANGE: instead of enabling all things as synchronous objects
                   only a few are sync steppable now. This change should
                   improve the performance of Simutrans, especially if many
                   vehicles are used.
         - FIX: fixed a bug in route calculation that could crash the game

09/20/01 - CHANGE: cleaned up vehikel_t class.
                -> saved 4 bytes per vehicle
                -> removed two unneeded methods
                -> moved a method into convoi_t class where it belongs
                -> reduced number of method calls from convoi_t to vehikel_t
                   during driving by 50%, this should speed up things a bit
         - FIX: fixed a wrong bounds check which could make the game crash
                in route_t

09/19/01 - FIX: if a game was loaded and right after loading saved all
                industry buildings showed up as construction areas forever
                after loading again. This problem is fixed now.
         - NEW: added a new industry: furniture factory

09/16/01 - FIX: textinput fields release focus now if the containing window is
                closed
         - FIX: it was possible to choose invalid color sets by clicking left
                or right of the color bars in the color chooser window. This
                problem is fixed now.
         - FIX: fixed a bug which crashed the game when a vehicle entered
                a depot while the vehicle info window was opened

         The following fixes fix problems introduced with the new tunnel
         and bridge data structures or were done by Volker who wrote the
         new data structures and associated code:

         - FIX: fixed visibility of vehicles entering and leaving tunnels
         - FIX: fixed visibility of vehicles driving uphill/downhill
         - FIX: fixed vehicle smoke creation for tunnels
         - FIX/NEW: Merged Volkers changes:
           - Fixes to compile Simutrans with MS Visual C++
           - Fixed a problem in pipeline/powerline code
           - Positioning of the relief map works now with big maps, too
           - Added a replacement for 'opendir()' which is unknown to VC
           - Removed some printf's from blockmanager code
           - Optimized access to ground objects
           - Moved updates of the relief map into ground object class
           - Fixed an array  bounds violation problem in vehicle routing
             code. This bug was probably very seldom triggered.
           - Removed unneeded methods from the squares objects
           - Changed vehicle movement a bit.
           - Fixed a problem in the bridge building tool

09/09/01 - CHANGE: World display in convoi and station windows fixed
         - FIX: Industries get a proper list of worker residential cities
                even after creating a new map.
         - FIX: Display of desired destinations in city info window fixed

09/08/01 - FIX: Renaming of newly build vehicles works now
         - BUG: The window title gets translated automatically. If by
                accident the vehicles new name is included as string
                in the language file the window title displays the translation
                for this string instead of the string itself.
         - NEW: Version stamp for saved games
         - NEW: Version check and error message when loading saved games
         - CHANGE: Cleaned up fahrer_t, vehikel_t hierarchies: removed
                methods which were no longer used after Volkers changes

09/06/01 - NEW: Released semi-official Simutrans version 0.78.12
         - CHANGE: updated todo list
         - CHANGE: mail offices can no longer be build on roads and railroads
         - CHANGE: maps with invalid rail blocks can be loaded again
                (added Volkers hack). I'm not sure if this fixes the problem
                but at least you can load the maps again and try to go on
                with the game.
                -> This change is untested because I had no saved maps with
                   invalid rail blocks.

09/04/01 - NEW: A limited file chooser for loading/saving games. Allows to
                enter names for games, up to 60 characters per game. Does not
                work on operating systems which have less than 60 chars per
                filename. This allows to have more than 5 different savegames.
                -> All existing savegame files need to be renamed to *.sve
                   manually, because the new Simutrans version only detects
                   *.sve files!!!
         - NEW: Clicking the entries of the vehicle list now opens the
                vehicle information window of the clicked vehicle. This way
                you can inspect your vehicle fleet very easily.

08/24/01 - FIX: "Bankrupt" message is displayed if a player is bankrupt
                (Was hidden due to some other changes in the code)
         - CHANGE: "You are in dept" messages now tell how many months are
                left to pay back the money.
         - CHANGE: updated todo list
         - NEW: Factories do not deliver goods to stations where more than
                1000 units of the same good are already stored. This should
                support a fair distribution of goods if several routes exist
                and one route has only a tiny transport capacity. Formerly
                all routes got the same amount of goods and if the tiny routes
                transport capacity was below that, immense amounts of goods
                were piled up at the tiny routes source stop. Now the tiny
                route is capped once 1000 units are stored on it's stop and
                the other routes are preferred by the factory.
         - NEW: Released unofficial version 0.78.11exp

08/23/01 - NEW: new station info and station detail windows
                -> renaming stations is now possible
                -> station window now has scrollbars to scroll big
                   goods/passenger lists
         - CHANGE: heavy workaround to get station name synced with
                displayed name (due to a design mistake in an earlier stage)
         - BUG: text input fields keep input focus if window gets closed.

08/22/01 - CHANGE: change convoi info window to use the new UI classes.
                This cleans up some code and streamlines more of the UI.
         - NEW: added text input facility for changing convoi name to
                convoi info window -> this allows to change vehicle names!
         - NEW: text area component (only used in new convoi window so far)

08/20/01 - FIX: Fixed a bug which crashed the game if a new map was created,
                then the game was quit and again a new map with more cities
                was created (caused by deleting the new number of cities
                instead of the old number).

08/17/01 - CHANGE: included Owens update for the money dialog
                   Negative values are now displayed in red.
         - CHANGE: adapted a few more dialogs to the rule:
                   unchangeable values -> black
                   changeable/changing values -> white
                   This way the player can see immediately which values are
                   fixed and which are supposed to be changed/changing

07/01/01 - NEW: built a new BeOS release (0.78.10exp)

06/30/01 - NEW: merged Owens finance window update
         - NEW: (internal) label text can now have other colors than black
         - CHANGE: to unify the finance window look with existing dialogs
                all changing entries are displayed in white, all constant
                entries are displayed in black now

06/23/01 - NEW: assigned click sounds to more actions to give a better
                feedback to the user

06/22/01 - FIX: sometimes the interrupt routine was called while it
                was already running. In rare cases this could lead to a
                double free() of the same object. The second free was
                likely to crash the game (C++ standard says something
                about undefined behavior in that case) or do even worse.
                This is fixed now, the interrupt routine can't be called
                any more if it is running already.

06/20/01 - NEW: added command line switches -h, -?, -help and --help
                which all print a help message
         - NEW: added a few more debug (error and fatal error) messages
                to loading/saving railroad tracks with invalid rail block
                IDs. This won't help the player immediately but allows better
                bug reports.
         - NEW: added a -screensize option to choose arbitrary resolutions
                This also allows to run Simutrans windowed in multiple
                window sizes.
         - FIX: fixed a problem which crashed the game if a station building
                had its name set to NULL. This should not happen normally
                but NULL should be a allowed value for a name string
                (meaning 'no name'). Now the program should be able to cope
                with station building names which are NULL. Usually this
                problem was reported as "The game crashes if I click a station"
         - CHANGE: found some more printf calls and replaced them by calls
                to the new logging system.

06/17/01 - CHANGE: Info windows display a bit of the environment, too, now,
                instead of just the objects square. This required changes to
                the clipping check in simgraph.c
         - BUG: new clipping support for graphics isn't perfect. The last
                line of graphics in the main display is not drawn correctly.
                In general clipping for images seems to truncate the last line
                while other drawing functions are fine. Workaround: draw one
                additional line (this hides the effects).
         - NEW: finance statistics get loaded/saved. Old savegames can be
                read; all finance stats are set to 0 when reading old games.
         - NEW: finance statistics get reset to 0 every year
         - NEW: Released unofficial version 0.78.8exp

06/16/01 - NEW: Translated Owens finance window entries
         - NEW: Finished work on vehicle list window
         - NEW: Painted two icons (finances, vehicles) for the toolbar
                to open the new finances and vehicle list windows
         - FIX: Fixed two bugs in the scrollpane class which displayed
                scrollbars at wrong position if the scrollpane was not
                located at (0,0)
         - BUG: Finance statistics/informations are not yet loaded/saved
         - CHANGE: Increased max speed of private cars

06/15/01 - CHANGE: Merged Owens finance window routines
         - FIX: Finance window title bar is now displayed in player colors
         - NEW: Started working on vehicle list window

06/14/01 - NEW: Released official version 0.78.7exp

06/13/01 - NEW: Built official version 0.78.7exp

06/09/01 - FIX: building signals directly adjacent to tunnels/bridges works
                now.
         - FIX: removing signals near bridges/tunnels works now.
         - CHANGE: adjusted station timeout to new timeflow. It's now again
                   90 days (was less than 1 day)
         - BUG: The block repair tool does not work if there is a train
                waiting on a bridge and the block below the bridge shall
                be repaired. In this case the train on the bridge is counted
                as if it was on the ground block and the wagon counter of
                the ground block is set too high.

06/06/01 - FIX: fixed a problem during image calculation in the schiene class
                which could crash the game during destruction of a map, i.e.
                if a new game was loaded.

06/02/01 - CHANGE: Changed a lot more printf calls to calls to the new
                   debug/logging class. I hope I have changed all of them!
         - CHANGE: Changed a suspicious piece of code in window management:
                   if you had 31 or 32 windows open, and closed a window,
                   the program read data behind the window array. This data
                   was copied into the window array. In general there was too
                   much data copied but usually within the window array.
                   I don't know how harmful it is to read from behind arrays,
                   but nevertheless this is fixed now.
         - CHANGE: Changed another  suspicious piece of code in window
                   management: similar to above but executed when a window was
                   topped.
         - CHANGE: Increased the window array size from 32 to 64 entries,
                   this means up to 64 subwindows can be displayed.
         - CHANGE: The behavior for "-log" was changed. The output is now
                   written into the 'simu.log' file AND into the console window
                   (was only 'simu.log' before).
         - CHANGE: Changed default resolution from 640x480 to 80x600. There
                   were never ever problems with higher resolutions reported,
                   so this seems to be fairly safe.
         - CHANGE: Stations without ground squares have name "Unnamed" until
                   a ground is added to the station. This fixes a possible
                   crash when inquiring stations to early or late.
         - FIX: fixed a bug which blocked the railway line if a
                one-way signal was removed. Now it's safe to remove one-way
                signals, too!

06/01/01 - CHANGE: Changed a lot of printf calls to calls to the new
                   debug/logging class, rated as "Message", "Warning",
                   "Error" and "Fatal error". Fatal error quit the program
                   immediately.

05/27/01 - NEW: Added more error detections to the id_handle template
                (tombstone id checks). This checks should catch about 50% of
                all internal data corruption problems. (The other 50% can't be
                checked because in those cases the result of the corruption is
                a valid tombstone ID again).
         - CHANGE: changed "Warning: Convoi was saved in state 4 or 5"
                   to "Message: Convoi was saved in state 4 or 5"
                   because this is not an error, but normal program action.

05/26/01 - CHANGE: Tried to migrate to from Allegro 3.9.32 to Allegro 3.9.36
                   Compiled and installed new Allegro Library for Windows.
                   -> Supports now DirectX up to version 7.0, hopefully
                      this will save some of the "no suitable graphics
                      driver found" problems.
                   -> 'simuwin -res 5' runs Simutrans in a window nicely now
                      (Windows version only, other versions have window by
                      default)

05/24/01 - CHANGE: Translated debug messages in rail block manager
         - CHANGE: Loading a map now tells how many factories trains/convois
                   are loaded
         - CHANGE: Improved id_handle_tpl for better checking if a handle is
                   bound to an object
         - CHANGE: Adapted automatic tests for tombstone checking
         - CHANGE: Cleaned up code in rail block and rail block manager
                   classes
         - CHANGE: Stations are now using handles and tombstones, too
         - CHANGE: Translated a few more messages from the tools

05/23/01 - NEW: Tombstone/id_handle templates allows to check for dangling
                pointer in all classes retrofitted with tomstone tables
         - CHANGE: Retrofitted rail block class with tombstone table
         - CHANGE: Split rail block classes and rail block management code
                   into two files

    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Made a break to gather my thoughts and find new solutions for some
    problems with Simutrans.
    ------------------------------------------------------------------

04/22/01 - NEW: Map preview in map selection window (new game window)
         - NEW: Included Tilli's new vehicle setup routines for smoother
                starting of vehicles.
         - CHANGE: relief map look changed

04/21/01 - CHANGE: Text input fields have a cursor now, changed handling of
                input focus a bit
         - CHANGE: rearranged ground and road images to allow multiple
                sets of ground images
         - FIX: renaming cities from loaded games works now


04/19/01 - NEW: Text input fields
         - CHANGE: City info window uses text input field

04/14/01 - FIX: found an array bounds violation in simgraph.c in a
                text drawing routine. This caused random crashes and other
                strange behavior if text was drawn half-outside the screen.
         - FIX: found an array bounds violation in simgraph.c in another
                text drawing routine. Nearly as evil as the bug mentioned
                above.
         - FIX: fixed an array bounds violation in simsound.cc
                If no sound card was detected the first MIDI title read from
                music.tab was read into midi_titles[-1] and overwrote an
                helper array of the AI. This made the game crash when the AI
                was using the values from this array.

04/13/01 - FIX: removing one of those smoke-clouds crashed the game. This is
                fixed now. This bug could be triggered either by using the
                'remover' tool or by building something on squares which
                contained clouds.
         - CHECK: it was reported that removing rails or roads and thus
                breaking a vehicles route would crash the game. This
                could not be reproduced.
         - CHANGE: included new en.tab, fi.tab, fr.tab and es.tab
                (language files)

04/11/01 - FIX: fixed a bug which aborted the game if empty spaces in the
                depot were clicked while being in sell mode
         - FIX: midi playlist displays message
                "Musicplaying disabled/not available" if either no MIDI
                files could be loaded or if the soundcard could not be
                initialized successfully
         - FIX: Song name in playlist is updated if a new song starts
                playing

04/09/01 - Merged Owens new sound routines: a simple MIDI playlist UI
           for browsing the MIDI files forward and backward.
         - CHANGE: Unified look of playlist UI with other Simutrans UI

04/08/01 - Released 0.78.0

04/07/01 - CHANGE: en.tab and de.tab updated, included corrections from
                Seth and Dirk.
         - CHANGE: included new hungarian language file
         - CHANGE: translated a few more debug/info messages from german
                to english.
         - FIX: included Tilli's tree placement fix.

04/04/01 - FIX: clicking an empty entry in the engines area of a depot
                window no longer aborts the game. This bug was introduced
                during the changes in 0.77.6 when a bounds checked array was
                introduced as container for engines ... a failed bounds
                check aborted the game in this case.

04/01/01 - CHANGE: AI build trains of different length now
         - CHANGE: AI uses different engine types now
         - FIX: AI no longer buys trailers without trucks

03/31/01 - NEW: New industry: Bookshop (painted by Tuomas, tiled by me)
         - NEW: New vehicle: Book van (painted by Sergiu, modified by me)
         - NEW: New good: Books
         - NEW: New private car (painted by Dirk, recolored by me)
         - CHANGE: included new powerlines from Daniel
         - CHANGE: included new transformer station from Daniel
         - CHANGE: Doubled the running cost for all locos, they were
                smaller than the average truck running cost before.
                Now running costs for train engines are higher than
                truck running costs in average.
         - CHANGE: Raised the capacity of all trucks by 10-30%.
                Trucks should be able to compete (at least sometimes)
                with trains.
         - CHANGE: Power station has now upto three suppliers (was two
                formerly). I hope this is enough to produce electric energy
                more continuously.

03/28/01 - CHANGE: compiled a new Linux test version with a different setup
                of libraries (left out all DGA libs in Allegro setup).
                The new version runs on a wider range of Linux systems now.

03/23/01 - CHANGE: Cleanups for new map window, sets scroll positions to
                actual map coordinates when opening a new map window.
         - CHANGE: Text drawing routines can now choose from two fixed
                width fonts and one proportional font.
         - CHANGE: The image of the power connectors at power stations was
                changed to a grey power line segment.
         - CHANGE: Linux version can now be built with Allegro, sound and
                music works, mouse is self-managed as in windows fullscreen
                mode:
         - NEW: Sound effect for income/expenditure.

03/22/01 - NEW: Powerlines. Power stations get power connectors. The player
                can place transformer stations near other industries and
                connect power stations power connectors and the transformer
                stations with powerlines.
                Hotkeys: 'g' to place a transformer station
                         'l' to build a powerline
         - NEW: A 4x7 font, used in relief map to display town names.
                Small and hard to read.
         - CHANGE: Event handling during scrolling changed. Now the frame_time
                is no longer changed during dragging the map. This should
                prevent some possible problems (passenger rate) with a
                ridiculous fast looping main loop (which was the result
                of a map drag before).
         - CHANGE: Fixed width font drawing routines clip correctly now.

03/21/01 - CHANGE: Goods/destination objects changed from heap allocation to
                stack allocation and to value variables instead of pointers.
                The former solution (heap/pointers) was always a source of
                problems. The new implementation should be more robust
                against several error types (dangling pointers!).
                It's probably not more correct than before, but allows
                to keep playing even if an error occurred. This solution
                needs to copy more memory (16/24 bytes instead of four
                for each assignment but saves one indirection on each value
                access and saves calls to new/delete. All in all it seems to
                be roughly as fast as before (no measurable difference). I
                think, it's even faster now.
         - CHANGE: Changed event queue indices in simsys_d.c to unsigned types.
                They were always checked for higher bound, but not for
                lower bound. Making them unsigned prevents the occurrence of
                negative values, and a higher bound check is now sufficient
                to ensure values of valid range. Similar to the change above,
                this might not be more correct than before but it should be
                more robust against errors than before.
         - CHANGE: Changed a few more lists to list templates to gain type
                safe interfaces. Should allow better error checking by the
                compiler.
         - CHANGE: Changed memory allocation scheme of map squares. They prefer
                to keep memory instead of freeing it. They just free memory
                if they have space for more than 32 objects but contain less
                than 8 objects. In other cases they keep the allocated space.
                This reduces the number of calls to new/delete and should
                therefore speed up the program, but it might use up to
                four times more memory than before (couldn't verify this, the
                game needed 12 megs to play a 256x256 map before and still
                needs less than 13 megs for a 256x256 map).

03/20/01 - FIX: Fixed a bugs which destroyed the freelist of the
                node_container_t by accident. Cause was a freelist=0
                in the constructor of the node_container while
                freelist is a static member and should not be nulled
                in the constructor.result was a memory leak.
         - CHANGE: Allow putback of node lists in node_container_t. This
                reduces the number of calls to new and delete and should
                be more efficient. It simplifies code and moved two
                implementations to a single source, thus enhancing
                maintainability. The queue_t and Stack classes benefit from
                this feature.
         - FIX: Fixed a memory leak in sound_frame_t. Sliders and labels
                are now data fields of the class instead allocated separately
                on the heap. This way they are automatically freed if the
                frame is deleted.
         - CHANGE: Updated two of my houses, adjusted window sizes and wall
                colors. Added a lamp (lit at night) to one of the houses.

03/19/01 - CHANGE: Some memory management changes started:
                - reduced number of calls to new/delete by reusing
                  node objects (nodes are used in all linked data containers
                  and are allocated/deallocated very frequently
                - changed HNode and KNode (goods routing and vehicle
                  routing) memory management to use freelists.

03/18/01 - CHANGE: Image updates from Trikky and Oskari included
         - CHANGE: Mouse pointer no longer visible during loading,
                saving and while creating a new map. This prevents the
                'footsteps' problem.

                just 'touchable' as before.

03/14/01 - NEW: MIDI playing routines by Owen Rudge integrated
         - NEW: MIDI volume selector to sound control added

03/10/01 - NEW: A very simple savegame chooser. Allows to select one
                of five savegame slots for loading and saving a game
         - FIX: Fixed a bug in convoi (train) loading code. There was
                a little chance that convois (trains) were saved in an
                inconsistent state. This fix recovers the convoi state
                during loading the game.
         - CHANGE: added a new interface class for listening for button
                press events to the gui class hierarchy
         - CHANGE: tried to enhance timer precision from 5 ms to 2 ms
                (Only Windows version, other versions already had a

         - CHANGE: replaced one of Trikkys buildings with an updated
                version
         - CHANGE: included steam loco sound

                was not set correctly and a wrong image was displayed
                for some time. This is fixed now.
         - CHANGE: map window display maps <= 256x256 squares without
                scrolling, bigger maps are displayed in a scrollable
                window of 250x250 pixels in size. (Currently the
                scrollbars are just inactive during the display of
                smaller maps).
         - FIX: X-Windows: Exposure-event wird jetzt richtig verarbeitet

                with tips from Frans. Gained another 6-10% in speed.

02/24/01 - CHANGE: Large cities call INT_CHECK more frequently now.
                This makes vehicles movement smoother.
         - CHANGE: Passengers are routed in groups of three if possible,
                this enhances overall performance in games with
                big cities.
         - CHANGE: Drawing routines rewritten in assembly language,
                now at least 15% faster than before.

           images for the crossings itself

01/04/01 - Changing the program to use the new ground and way classes
         - Ran some tests to see if the new ground classes work well
