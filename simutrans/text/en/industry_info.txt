<h1><strong>Industry Information</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Industry Information</strong> shows details about a selected Industry (a supplier or consumer of goods) and allows game-view to be moved to related positions in game-world.
</p>
<p>
Suppliers and consumers of goods link to provide an Industry Supply Chain which terminates in an end-consumer. Some Industry is both a consumer and supplier and lies in the middle of an Industry Supply Chain. If not playing in <a href="new_world.txt">beginners mode</a>, Industry will cease supply if consumer has excess supply.<br>
Industries may also be a destination for and origin of passengers and mail. Vehicles collect and deliver goods and passengers to an Industry through <a href="station.txt">Stops</a> if the catchment area of the Stop covers any portion of the Industry building and if the Stop can handle the item.

<p>
The intial number of Industry Supply Chains can be set in <a href="new_world.txt">Create New World</a>.
As <a href="citywindow.txt">urban areas</a> grow more industry may appear. New industry appears each time the population of an urban area doubles from about 2000 onwards.<br>
{Tips: Add Industry to an urban area using <a href="edittools.txt">Build a new market in the nearest city</a> tool in ?Game Edit Tools. Change when new industries are generated in cityrules.tab (industry_increase_every = 0 generates no new industry)}.
