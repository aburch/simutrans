<p>
- <em>Name</em> orders alphabetically by the text of the marker.<br>
- <em>Map co-ordinate</em> orders numerically by the map co-ordinates of the marker.<br>
- <em>Player</em> orders alphabetically by the players whose markers are placed.<br>
</p>
<p>
- <em>ascending</em> / <em>descending</em> reverses the order of the list.
