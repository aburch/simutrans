<title>Game Interface Usage</title>

<h1><strong>Game Interface</strong></h1>

<p>
<a href="simutrans.txt">Simutrans</a> is played through the <strong>Game Interface</strong>, which provides information about the current game, access to toolbars & game-controls and a view of the current game-world. Simutrans can be controlled via <a href="mouse.txt">mouse</a> and via <a href="keys.txt">keyboard</a>. The keyboard layout is available in the help menu at <em>Keyboard Binding</em> section, or pressing <a href="keys.txt">[F1]</a> key, and also appears every time a key without function is pressed.<br>
IMPORTANT: Keys are case-sensitive.
</p>

<p>
<it>Game Window</it>
</p>

<p>
Shows a portion of the current game-world. You can zoom-in and zoom-out using the mouse wheel, or <a href="keys.txt">[PgUp]</a>/<a href="keys.txt">[PgDown]</a> keys, or two dedicated icons found on the main toolbar. Scroll the map in several ways:
<br>  Hold down the right mouse button and scroll the map in any direction towards your desired position. In the default setting, the map scrolls against the movement of the mouse. You can change this behaviour in <a href="display.txt">Display Settings</a> window.
<br>  Use the numeric keypad.
<br>  Jump directly to a desired map section by selecting the appropriate point on the <a href="map.txt">Map Window</a>.
<br>  Jump to specific coordinates using <a href="jump_frame.txt">Jump to</a> dialog (press <a href="keys.txt">[J]</a> key).
</p>

<p>
The names of several objects are editable, such as towns, factories, stations, vehicles and transport lines. To edit, click with the mouse in the name field of the dialog opened by the <a href="inspection_tool.txt">Inspection Tool</a> (see below). Edits become effective immediately. Press <a href="keys.txt">[Return]</a> to exit the field.
</p>

<p>
<it>Title Bar</it>
</p>

<p>
The left part of the titlebar shows the version and release date of Simutrans that is currently running. The right hand side of the titlebar contains controls to minimize, maximize the <strong>Game Interface</strong> and also to exit Simutrans.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the game window is a row of icons (<em>main toolbar</em>) used to access game-toolbars and game-controls when playing Simutrans. Icons (click to use) are grouped in several menus:
</p>

<p>
<it>Main Menu</it>
</p>

<p>
<a href="options.txt"><em>Options:</em></a> The floppy-disk-icon opens a dialogue from where you can load, save or start a new game.
</p>

<p>
<a href="map.txt"><em>Map:</em></a> The overview map of the world with its objects shows the movements of the player vehicles and allows seeing some statistical views. If you select a point on this map, the game window jumps to the corresponding image section.
</p>

<p>
<a href="inspection_tool.txt"><em>Inspection Tool:</em></a> The magnifying-glass-icon symbolizes the query tool. If it is active, the cursor also becomes a magnifying glass. If you select an object with it (building, vehicle, etc.), an information window will be displayed above it. It is advisable to always return to magnifying glass, especially if you have just worked with the <a href="removal_tool.txt">Removal Tool</a>. So you avoid destroying an object accidentally, instead of calling up the object information.
