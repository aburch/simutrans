<h1><strong>Convoy Information</strong></h1>

<p>
<strong>Convoy Information</strong> provides information about a Convoy (an operational vehicle or combination of vehicle-units) which is used to transport goods and passengers.<br>
It lists items carried by a Convoy and also has controls to access further details and sell the Convoy; follow the Convoy in game-view; and change the name and <a href="schedule.txt">Schedule</a> of the Convoy.
</p>

<p>
A Convoy is composed of at least one powered (motorised) vehicle-unit and any attached trailers/carriages.<br>
Examples of Convoys include: a team of horses pulling a carriage; or a train engine attached to a tender and carriages; or a bus; or a van; or a truck attached to a trailer; or connected tram cars; or a ship; or a tugboat pulling a barge; or an aircraft.<br>
Convoys are assembled and purchased from the <a href="depot.txt">depot</a> for their type of transport.<br>
{Tips: A Convoy has a maximum limit of vehicle-units in its composition, dependent on the pakset. Trains are typically limited to 24 carriages.}
