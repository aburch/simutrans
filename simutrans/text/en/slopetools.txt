TIPS:<br>
  <strong>Landscaping Tools</strong> are easier to use with grid, press <a href="keys.txt">[#]</a> and zoom-in the game-view.<br>
  Use <a href="removal_tool.txt">Destroy/Removal Tool</a> to remove some obstructions.<br>
  Depending on map, tools can raise land into/out of water.<br>
  Lowering the land to a certain level creates a channel.<br>
