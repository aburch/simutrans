# City electricity consumption over the years. This does not affect industry consumption.
# The numbers other than years are percentages, and should be integers (i.e., no decimal point).

# Source of data (1920 onwards): https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-electricity-data-1920-to-2011

# Figures before 1920 and after 2010 are educated guesses. Data are for the UK: other countries might vary.
