# The ranges *may* overlap. These values are in kilometres.

# 2% of journeys are >50 miles (80km)

#################################### Revenue settings ##################################
#
# Settings for calibrating the revenue system
#
# These settings calibrate the way in which revenue is calculated in the game. Changing
# them might make the game easier or harder, or, if they are changed in odd ways, make it
# behave eratically. Make sure to know what you are doing before changing these values.

# These settings calibrate the speed bonus. Note that, with Simutrans-Experimental, unlike
# Simutrans-Standard, the speed bonus is based on the convoy or line's *average* speed, not
# the convoy's maximum speed. 
#
# All distances in these settings are measured in kilometres and calibrated using the
# meters_per_tile setting.
#
# min_bonus_max_distance is the distance below which the speed bonus (or penalty) does not
# apply. Below this distance, goods pay the same no matter what the average speed.
#
# median_bonus_distance is the distance at which 100% of the speed bonus/penalty applies. 
# At anything between min_bonus_max_distance and median_bonus_distance, a scaled proportion
# of the speed bonus applies. For example, if the min_bonus_max_distance was 10, and the 
# median_bonus_distance was 110, then, for a journey of 50 tiles, 50% of the speed bonus or
# penalty would apply. median_bonus_distance is optional: if it is not specified, or set to
# 0, it will be calculated as the mid point between min_bonus_max_distance and
# max_bonus_min_distance.
#
# max_bonus_min_distance is the distance above which the rate of the speed bonus increases
# no further. In other words, the rate of the speed bonus (or penalty) keeps increasing with
# the distance, until it reaches the max_bonus_min_distance, after which it remains steady.
#
# max_bonus_multiplier_percent is the percentage of the speed bonus that applies at or above
# the distance specified in max_bonus_min_distance. So, if the speed bonus rating was 10%, the
# distance exceeded the max_bonus_min_distance value, and the max_bonus_multiplier_percent was
# set to 200, the speed bonus rating would effectively be 20% for that journey.
# Between the median_bonus_distance and the max_bonus_min_distance, a scaled proportion applies.
# So, if, for example, the median_bonus_distance was 100, the max_bonus_min_distance was 1,100
# the actual distance 500, and the max_bonus_multiplier_percent 200, the speed bonus rating
# would be increased by half of the multiplier, or 150%.

min_bonus_max_distance = 4
median_bonus_distance = 100
max_bonus_min_distance = 300
max_bonus_multiplier_percent = 300

# These next settings affect the interaction between comfort and revenue in Simutrans. Comfort only
# affects passenger traffic, for obvious reasons. Passengers have a certain level of comfort that
# they will tolerate for certain distances. All comfort ratings are in the range of between 0 and
# 255. At the tolerable level, the revnue is unaffected. At above the tolerable level, a luxury
# bonus is applied. At below the tolerable level, a discomfort penalty is applied. The values can
# be set to anything, but, to reflect real life, it is suggested that the discomfort penalty is
# significantly higher than the luxury bonus. 
#
# tolerable_comfort_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle (0 - 255) for a journey of no
# more than tolerable_comfort_short_minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_short is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_short minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_median is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_median minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_median_long is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of no more
# than tolerable_comfort_median_long minutes.
#
# tolerable_comfort_long is the tolerable comfort rating of a vehicle for a journey of at least
# tolerable_comfort_long minutes.
#
# For any journeys of a time between any of the values, a scaled proportion is taken. 
# 
# Note that (versions 7.2 onwards), the impact of comfort on revenue decreases with journey time.
# It is at its maximum level down to tolerable_comfort_median_long_minutes, after which it gradually
# reduces to 20% of its maximum at tolerable_comfort_short_minutes, and does not decrease further
# thereafter.

# max_luxury_bonus_differential is the maximum number of comfort rating points above the tolerable level
# that affects the luxury bonus. Anything beyond that, and further added luxury makes no difference to the
# revenue.
#
# max_luxury_bonus_percent is the percentage increase in revenue from the maximum level of luxury specified in
# max_luxury_bonus_differential. So, if the tolerable comfort level for any given travelling time was 100, the 
# max_luxury_bonus_differential 50, and the max_luxury_bonus_percent 50, then the revenue would increase up to
# 50% beyond the normal revenue for additional comfort up to 150, but would not increase further with any increase
# in comfort beyond 150. 

max_luxury_bonus_differential=55
max_luxury_bonus_percent=45

# The discomfort penalty works in exactly the same way as the comfort bonus. max_discomfort_penalty_percent is the
# percentage decrease in revenue from the maximum level of discomfort specified in max_discomfort_penalty_differential.

# These settings control the revenue that can be earned from catering and travelling post offices. Note that catering
# vehicles on a convoy also increase the comfort by a small amount, which has an indirect effect on the revenue. These
# settings do not affect that: these settings affect the revenue earned from the catering itself: i.e., by selling food
# and drink. 
#
# catering_min_minutes is the shortest journey time that will provide any catering revenue. Anything below that, and 
# passengers will not bother to buy any food or drink at all. 
#
# catering_level1_minutes is the journey time at which any convoy with a catering level of 1 or higher will earn, per
# passenger, the number of Simu-cents (1/100th of a Simucredit) specified in catering_level1_max_revenue. 
# 
# The same applies for each subsequent catering level: in other words, higher catering levels only earn more than lower
# catering levels on journeys of at least the catering_levelX_minutes (where X is the catering level in question).
#
# Between each level, the a scaled proportion is applied. So, for example, if catering_min_minutes is 100, 
# catering_level1_minutes is 200, and the actual journey time is 150 minutes, then, any convoy with a catering level 
# of at least 1 will earn 50% of the amount specified in catering_level1_max_revenue per passenger.

# Travelling post office revenue is simpler than catering revenue. For every journey that mail makes in a convoy containing
# a travelling post office vehicle (that is, a mail carrying vehicle with a catering level above zero) where the journey time

# These settings relate to private car use. See /config/privatecar.tab for

#
# "Base car preference percent" is the chance, expressed in percentage, that, all
# other things being equal, a passenger with a private car will choose to use that
# car in preference to using public (i.e., the player's) transport. Higher values
# are more realistic; lower values make the game easier. 
# 
# "Always prefer car percent" is the percentage of drivers who prefer to use their
# car no matter how congested the roads. The remaining percentage of drivers are 
# deterred from using their car to go to or from (or within) towns that have a
# high level of congestion. The default is 10. 
#
# "Congestion density factor" is the factor by which the population density (in
# citizens per tile) is divided to get a factor multiplied by the number of cars
# per tile per month to get the congestion figure. In simple terms, the lower this
# number, the easier that it will be for cities to register as congested, and 
# the more likely that it is that passengers will opt for public (i.e., the player's)
# transport instead. If "congestion density factor" is set to zero, then the congestion
# will be calculated using a much simpler formula that does not depend on the city's
# population density at all.  
#
# To revert to the behaviour of Simutrans Standard (with no competition from private cars 
# at all), simply set "base_car_preference_percent" to 0. Passengers will then only choose
# private cars if no public transport is available.

# at the default wait time of 2,700, the maximum time that passengers are prepared to
# wait is 2,700 / 18 = 150 minutes, or two and a half hours. 
#
# The same applies for other sorts of goods: for example, the speed bonus value for
# mail is 15. So, with a passenger_max_weight of 2700, mail would wait for 180 
# minutes before being discarded.
#

# obsolete_running_cost_increase_percent was set to 200, it would cost 0.20c to

#
# The phase years stipulate how long it should be after the retirement date before the

# of years after the retirement date, a proportion of the increase percentage applies.
# For example, if the obsolete_running_cost_increase_phase_years was set to 10 in the 
# above example, then, 5 years after the retirement date for the vehicle, the running 
# costs would be 0.15c, and ten or more years after the retirement date, they would be

################################ Vehicle settings ##############################

# These settings determine how vehicles take corners, for each individual type of way.  They
# only apply to vehicles that use fixed ways (road, rail, monorail, etc.), and not aircraft or
# ships.
#
# Corner adjustment facotor (min/max) (%): The percentage of the normal speed limit applied
# on a 45 degree bend (for example, if the speed limit was 200kph, and the adjustment
# factor set to 50, the speed limit on the corner would be 100kph). 
# 
# Corner limit (min/max) (kph): The minimum and maximum speed limits for phasing of the 
# corner adjustment factor. On a way with the speed limit at or below the minimum limit,
# the minimum adjustment factor applies. On a way with the limit at or above the maximum
# speed limit, the maximum adjustment factor applies. Between the two, a phased proportion
# of the adjustment factor applies as a linear function of the difference between the two.
# For example, at halfway between the minimum and maximum speeds, halfway between the
# minimum and maximum adjustment factors apply.
#
# Direction steps (min/max) (number of tiles): The number of steps that the simulation takes
# into account when determining how sharp that a corner is. For example, if the number is set
# to 6, the corner speed limit will be based on the greatest difference in angle between the
# current direction and the direction in which the vehicle was travelling over the last 6 tiles.
# The higher the number, therefore, the more important that it is to have straight ways.
# Higher numbers should be set for railways and track based ways, and lower numbers for roadways.
# The direction steps are phased in the same way as the adjustment factor.
#
# Curve friction factor (x): The number of times extra friction that applies as a vehicle corners.
# Since the friction occasioned by cornering is not usually a significant speed limiting factor for
# most transport vehicles, it is recommended to set this to 0. It is preserved for those who prefer
# the Simutrans-Standard system of cornering.
#
# Reverting to the older cornering system: To make Simutrans behave in the conventional way (by
# using friction rather than speed limits to reduce speed in corners), set the minimum and
# maximum adjustment factors, and the minimum and maximum direction steps, to 1, and the friction
# factor to 8. With those settings, the minimum and maximum speed will be irrelevant.

#
# "unit_reverse_time_seconds" refers to trains/convoys, such as multiple units, that have
# a cab at each and, and can be driven in reverse without any re-arrangement of 
# the order of the vehicles. These will generally take the least time to reverse.
#
# "hauled_reverse_time_seconds" refers to trains/convoys that cannot be driven from the

# to the rear, but where that locomotive can itself be driven in either direction,
# so that it does not need to turn around.
#
# "turntable_reverse_time_seconds" refers to trains/convoys that, as for the above category,
# cannot be driven from the rear, but that also require their locomotive to be turned
# around to face the other direction (such as steam locomotives with tenders) at the
# end of the journey. These will genearlly take the most time to reverse.
#
# All times are in game seconds. In previous versions, these were specified in internal
# milliseconds by "unit_reverse_time" (etc.) without "_seconds", but these values
# had to be adjusted manually to match the meters per tile setting. The old keywords
# "(unit_reverse_time)" etc. still work, but are overridden by the "..._seconds" version

# it had a power rating of 2,400kw. This setting is applied *in addition to* the

# 2.0 and the global_power_factor_percent was set to 200, the vehicle would behave
# as if it had a total power of 4,800kw. 
#
# The default is 100.
#
# Note that, in Simutrans-Experimental version 10.12 and later, Standard paksets
# should use a percentage of 50. This is because the physics have been recalibrated
# to account for transmission losses (intended to be set using the "gear" setting
# in each vehicle's .dat file), and the resistance values decreased accordingly.
# Therefore, without this reduction in power, vehicles will be substantially over-
